# DecisionTree-NeuralNetwork

Q1 - Decision Trees and Random Forest

Link to download the dataset can be found in ass3_v1.pdf - Q1.

Implemented tree structure in C++. Called the APIs from Python code.

To run - dtree.sh \<q1-part-number\> \<train-file-name\> \<test-file-name\> \<valid-file-name\>

Q2 - Neural Networks

Link to downlaod the dataset can be found in ass3_v1.pdf - Q2. Create a config.txt file using config_framework.txt (found in this folder). config_framework.txt file contains the type of values in line in config.txt.

Config file is the parameters that can be tuned to obtain different NN to solve a problem.

To run - nn.sh \<config-file-name\> \<train-file-name\> \<valid-file-name\>
